    <h2 style="text-align:center; margin-top:1em;">Our Story</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center; max-width:700px; margin:1em auto;">
      The idea for Norb's Fabulous Cafe was brewed during late nights and early mornings by two friends who shared a passion for great coffee and genuine connection. What started as a simple dream over a kitchen table turned into a warm and welcoming space for the whole neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; max-width:700px; margin:1em auto;">
      We built this place from the ground up â€” hand-painting walls, sanding tables, and tasting countless coffee blends until we found the perfect roast. Every detail, from the rustic wood decor to the smell of freshly baked pastries, reflects our love for quality and comfort.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; max-width:700px; margin:1em auto;">
      Today, Norb's Fabulous Cafe stands as a heartwarming spot where locals gather, travelers find rest, and every visitor is treated like family. Come in, grab a cup, and be part of our story.
